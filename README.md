Random Quote Generator made using Javascript, CSS and HTML! I used the Quotable API to pull the quotes.

Features:

- Random famous quotes from 800+ of the greatest people in history: just press the "Get Quote" button to get a new one!
- New "Quote of the Day" every day at your local 00:00 hs.
- List of all the authors that feature a quote on the website, along with a small biography and their picture.
- Contact form (powered by FormSpree), where you can send comments and suggestions.
